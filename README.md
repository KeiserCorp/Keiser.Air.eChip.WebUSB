# Keiser Air eChip WebUSB Library
![](https://github.com/KeiserCorp/Keiser.Air.eChip.WebUSB/workflows/Publish%20NPM/badge.svg?branch=production)

## Project
This library handles communication with the EChip USB reader using WebUSB.

Required Hardware: [USB to 1-Wire/iButton Adapter (DS9490)](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/ibutton/ibutton/DS9490.html)

Required Drivers: [1-Wire/iButton Drivers for Windows](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/ibutton/software/tmex/download_drivers.cfm)

## Installation
Install with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/): `npm install @keiser/echip-webusb`

## Usage

Import singleton instance from module using preferred module loading technique.
```ts
import EChipReaderWatcher from '@keiser/echip-webusb'

if (EChipReaderWatcher.isConnected) {
  console.log('EChip Reader Connected ðŸ˜„')
}
```

The `EChipReaderWatcher` handles permissions and USB connection events. On first load, the browser will not have provided a grant to the site to access the USB device, so the `EChipReaderWatcher.start()` method must be called by an event that originates from a user action. This may only be required once on the first visit to the site, or it may be required each time the site is loaded based on browser vendors preferred implementation.

```ts
connectButton.addEventListener('click', async () => {
  try {
    await EChipReaderWatcher.start()
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error.message)
  }
})
```

Once the `EChipReaderWatcher.start()` method has been called the class will prompt the browser for permission and begin watching for devices matching the EChip Readers device signature. To be alerted when a device is found, pass a function to the `EChipReaderWatcher.onConnect()` method.

```ts
EChipReaderWatcher.onConnect((echipReader) => {
  console.log('EChip Reader Connected ðŸ˜„')
})
```

The `EChipReaderWatcher.onConnect()` will pass in an `EChipReader` object which is the object bound to the physical device connected. This library is capable of handling multiple EChip Reader devices simultaneously, so the `onConnect()` method has potential for returning multiple `EChipReader` devices over the course of the application's life.

```ts
echipReader.onDisconnect(() => {
  console.log('EChip Reader Disconnected ðŸ˜ž')
})
```

The `EChipReader` object has a `onDisconnect()` method which will alert when the EChip Reader has been disconnected for some reason. Once an `EChipReader` object has been disconnected, it is disposed and cannot be used again. The next time the device is connected, a new `EChipReader` object will be returned.

```ts
echipReader.onEChipDetect(async (echip) => {
  console.log('EChip Connected: ' + echip.id)
  console.log(await echip.getData())
})
```

The `EChipReader` object also has an `onEChipDetect()` method which will alert when a valid EChip has been placed into the reader. The event passes in an `EChip` object that can be used to interact with the EChip data directly. Just like the `EChipReaderWatcher.onConnect()` method, the `EChipReader.onEChipDetect()` method can be called multiple times for multiple EChips all being handled concurrently. Once an EChip is disconnected, the `EChip` object is disposed and cannot be reused.

Full example usage:
```ts
import EChipReaderWatcher from '@keiser/echip-webusb'

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', event => {
  const connectButton = document.querySelector('#connect') as HTMLInputElement

  if (connectButton) {
    connectButton.addEventListener('click', async () => {
      try {
        await EChipReaderWatcher.start()
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(error.message)
      }
    })
  }

  EChipReaderWatcher.onConnect((echipReader) => {
    console.log('EChip Reader Connected ðŸ˜„')

    echipReader.onEChipDetect(async (echip) => {
      console.log('EChip Connected: ' + echip.id)
      console.log(await echip.getData())
    })

    echipReader.onDisconnect(() => {
      console.log('EChip Reader Disconnected ðŸ˜ž')
    })
  })
})
```

## API

### EChipReaderWatcher

The `EChipReaderWatcher` is a singleton class which handles the USB device monitoring and permissions handling. There can be only one `EChipReaderWatcher` instance created within a `window` scope, so the library instantiates the class during import and preserves a single instance for all imports.

#### Properties
| Name | Usage |
| ---- | ----- |
| `isConnected: boolean` | Indicates whether an eChip Reader Device is connected |

#### Methods
| Name | Usage |
| ---- | ----- |
| `onConnect(Listener<EChipReader>): Disposable` | Adds an event listener for when an eChip Reader Device is connected. Callback method will be passed the new `EChipReader` instance for the connected device. |
| `start(): Promise<void>` | Initializes the watcher by first requesting permissions and then doing a hardware search. This method must be triggered by a user action such as a click event or the permission request will be denied. |
| `stop(): Promise<void>` | Closes all active connections. |

### EChipReader

The `EChipReader` instance is passed into the `onConnect` callback function and is the interface to the connected eChip Reader Device.

#### Properties
| Name | Usage |
| ---- | ----- |
| `claimed: Promise<boolean>` | Promise indicating if the USB device interface has been claimed. |
| `disposed: boolean` | Indicates if the device connection has been severed and the class instance disposed. |

#### Methods
| Name | Usage |
| ---- | ----- |
| `onDisconnect(Listener<null>): Disposable` | Adds an event listener for when this eChip Reader Device becomes disconnected. The instance will be disposed after following this event. |
| `onEChipDetect(Listener<EChip>): void` | Adds an event listener for when an eChip is connected to the eChip Reader device. Callback method will be passed the new `EChip` instance for the connected eChip. |

### EChip

The `EChip` instance is passed into the `onEChipDetect` callback function and is the interface to the connected eChip device.

#### Properties
| Name | Usage |
| ---- | ----- |
| `id: string` | UUID string of the eChip. |

#### Methods
| Name | Usage |
| ---- | ----- |
| `destroy(): void` | Called to disconnect the eChip device. |
| `getData(): Promise<EChipObject>` | Promise resolves with an `EChipObject` representing the data on the eChip. |
| `clearData(): Promise<EChipObject>` | Method clears the data on the eChip and resolves with an `EChipObject` of the new blank eChip data. |
| `setData({string: MachineObject}): Promise<EChipObject>` | Method sets the data on the eChip according to the data passed into the method.  The method accepts an object with `string` keys corresponding to the machine's 4-digit model number with the `MachineObject` as the value of the property. |

  work: number | null
  distance: number | null
  chest: number | null
